                        <h3>The Island</h3>
                        <p>During the summer of 2015, I spent 3 weeks on the island of Paros participating in a photography program at the Aegean Center for the Fine Arts. I lived in one of their artist residences, a humble &quot;spitaki&quot; or traditional small house with the same cobble-stone floors as the street on the other side of its white-washed walls. The spitaki had little in the way of excess comforts. It consisted of one bedroom and a kitchen furnished with a hotplate and a sink. A small tank of water hung on the wall above a drain in the corner of the bathroom and required fifteen minutes to heat before reaching a tolerable temperature for bathing. When I moved in, I was provided with the WIFI password of a cafe adjacent to the building and was advised that the network was sporadically available from the roof.</p>
