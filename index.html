                        <h3>The Island</h3>
                        <p>During the summer of 2015, I spent 3 weeks on the island of Paros participating in a photography program at the Aegean Center for the Fine Arts. I lived in one of their artist residences, a humble &quot;spitaki&quot; or traditional small house with the same cobble-stone floors as the street on the other side of its white-washed walls. The spitaki had little in the way of excess comforts. It consisted of one bedroom and a kitchen furnished with a hotplate and a sink. A small tank of water hung on the wall above a drain in the corner of the bathroom and required fifteen minutes to heat before reaching a tolerable temperature for bathing. When I moved in, I was provided with the WIFI password of a cafe adjacent to the building and was advised that the network was sporadically available from the roof.</p>

                        <h3>The Art</h3>
                        <p>Every day I would rise early and have my breakfast at a restaurant down the street from the Aegean Center. Afterwards, I attended class led by an intensely passionate man named John Pack who possessed a seemingly boundless knowledge of every photographic realm from the minutia of technical skills to the most abstract level of theory. In the afternoons we would settle in the photo lab where we worked on a portfolio of images that we would show in an exhibition at the end of the program. I was consumed with the work. For the first time in my life I found myself singularly focused, each waking moment was spent in pursuit of my art. I learned how to print images on bamboo paper with a subtle attention to light, color, and tones that made them look almost like delicate paintings. The images I created during this time reflect the serenity of a place that truly feels like home to me. They stand in contrast to the Greece constructed in the news narrative.</p>

                        <h3>The Crisis</h3>
                        <p>When I wasn’t overcome with joy and inspiration that summer, I felt utter devastation. My stay on the island of Paros coincided with mounting anxiety and tension concerning the ever-worsening Greek Debt Crisis. Since I couldn’t access the internet from my house, I found myself spending all free time at the school, obsessively consuming any and all media coverage of the crisis. There were constant headlines, tweets, videos, articles, and whatever else. Friends from back home were messaging me to find out what was going on. I was enraged by the misrepresentation of Greece and the Greek people in the mainstream media. These news outlets portrayed the country as one full of lazy tax-evaders who were the architects of their own destruction. While there were grave errors made by Greek policy-makers, there was a disproportionately small amount of coverage that held organizations like the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund accountable for making loans to a country that they knew would default on its debt. These organizations, instead of coming up with a long-term solution to the debt issue, foisted austerity measures on the country and effectively tightened a noose around the neck of the Greek economy by taking money out of the pockets of consumers. Austerity measures have been widely criticized by prominent economists and experts as disastrously counterintuitive when it comes to helping a country reduce its debt. The severely contracting economy saw a huge swell in unemployment, cut pensions, and business closures and homelessness across the entire country. I watched as Greeks from the island lined up at ATMs to withdraw their money from accounts in small increments as fear mounted that the banks would freeze withdraws. <p id="TBC">To be continued</p></p>
