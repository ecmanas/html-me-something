                        <p>During the summer of 2015, I spent 3 weeks on the island of Paros to participate in a photography program at the Aegean Center for the Fine Arts. I lived in a humble &quot;spitaki&quot;, a traditional small house with the same cobble-stone floors as the street on the other side of its white-washed walls. The spitaki had little in the way of excess comforts. It was a small bedroom and a kitchen furnished with a hotplate and a sink. A small tank of water hung on the wall above a drain in the corner of the bathroom, within arm reach of the toilet, and required fifteen minutes to heat before reaching a tolerable temperature for bathing. When I moved in, I was provided with the WIFI password of a cafe adjacent to the building who encouraged me in a neighborly way to try and use their network by sitting on my roof.</p>
